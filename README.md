# Text_Classification_Drug_Review_Topic_Modelling

##**Overview**

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for text classification and topic modeling. The project applies natural language processing (NLP) techniques to categorize text data and uncover latent topics within a dataset. The dataset primarily focuses on the healthcare industry, particularly drug-related data, to derive insights and enhance decision-making.

## **Features**

**Text Preprocessing:** Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.

**Text Classification:** Uses machine learning models to classify text into predefined categories.

**Topic Modeling:** Implements techniques like Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to extract meaningful topics.

**Data Visualization:** Generates insights through word clouds, topic distributions, and classification performance metrics.

**Healthcare Industry Application:** Analyzes drug-related text data to classify and identify prevalent topics in pharmaceutical discussions, medical reviews, and drug research papers.
